# 11hauz
Website for 11hauz restaurant that I manage using materialize css. So far I've detemnined that materialize.css is not robust. It will fail on me in IE11 which I need to support. Therefore a move to bootstrap 4 is recommended for the future. This is not to say I wont use it on other projects. Just not this one for now.
